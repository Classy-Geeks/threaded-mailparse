===========================

This was an exercise/proof of concept to create a multi threaded command line mail parser. For this exercise we used ]exorus/php-mime-mail-parser](https://github.com/eXorus/php-mime-mail-parser) to handle the mail parsing. Also made use of PHP [pthreads](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pthreads.php) functionality. Any  functionality can be implemented, mail parsing was the purpose of the proof of concept to create a multi threaded command line tool in PHP.
