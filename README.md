threaded-mailparser
===========================

This was an exercise/proof of concept to create a multi threaded command line mail parser. For this exercise I used [exorus/php-mime-mail-parser](https://github.com/eXorus/php-mime-mail-parser) to handle the mail parsing. Any functionality can be implemented, mail parsing was the purpose of the proof of concept to create a multi threaded command line tool in PHP.
